Create content that provides value.

Even though you're promoting something that's not yours, you need to make it unique by adding your own value to it.

Examples could be:

* Training on how to use the product.
* Added value to the product (complementary information).
* A product you own at a discount.
* Etc…

Depending on the niche and kind of product, there are different ways to add your own value.

With information products, you can bundle to increase value.

Let's say your promoting a course on “Blogging", you can create and offer for free an added training on 1 awesome traffic source.

Yes, it requires a lot of work and this is not what most people starting affiliate marketing want to hear, but there's no other way to succeed.

**Add value to someone's life and value ($$) will be added to yours. Attempt to only promotoe other person's value and you'll find yourself hopping from product to product without visible results.**
